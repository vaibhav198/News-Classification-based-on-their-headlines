# News-Classification-based-on-their-headlines

Classify news into categories based on their headline using Multinomial Naive Bayesian Classifier.

Naive Bayesian model is based on probability.
First Naive bayesian scans whole dataset after that finds the probability of each word which is present in headline being associated with a class like "Business & Finance, Criminal, Health Care, Politics, Science & Health" and then find the probability for entire headline hence it works good.
